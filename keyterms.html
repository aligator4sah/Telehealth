					<br><a name="anchor3">
					3. <b>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</b>  - The Advanced Encryption Standard specifies a U.S. governmentapproved
					cryptographic algorithm that can be used to protect electronic data. The AES algorithm is a symmetric block cipher that
					can encrypt (encipher) and decrypt (decipher) information. This standard specifies the Rijndael algorithm, a symmetric 
					block cipher that can process data blocks of 128 bits, using cipher keys with
					lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits.  </br>

					<br><a name="anchor4">

					types of malware and prevent or contain malware incidents. </br>

					<br><a name="anchor5">
					5. <b>Authentication</b>  - Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often as a
					prerequisite to allowing access to resources in an information system. Encompasses identity verification, message origin authentication, and message content authentication.The process of verifying the identity or other attributes claimed by or
					assumed of an entity (user, process, or device), or to verify the source and integrity of data.  </br>

					<br><a name="anchor6">
					6. <b>Authorization</b>  - Access privileges granted to a user, program, or process or the act
					of granting those privileges.   </br>

					<br><a name="anchor7">

					<br><a name="anchor9">
					9. <b>Certification</b>  - A comprehensive assessment of the management, operational, and
					technical security controls in an information system, made in support
					of security accreditation, to determine the extent to which the
					controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and
					producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security
					requirements for the system.  </br>

					<br><a name="anchor10">
					10. <b>Digital Signature</b>   - An asymmetric key operation where the private key is used to digitally sign data and 
					the public key is used to verify the signature. Digital signatures provide authenticity protection, integrity
					protection, and non-repudiation.  </br>

					<br><a name="anchor11">
					11. <b>Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)</b>   - A written plan for recovering one or more information systems at an
					alternate facility in response to a major hardware or software failure or destruction of facilities.  </br>

					<br><a name="anchor13">
					13. <b>Encrypted Key</b>   - A cryptographic key that has been encrypted using an Approved security function with 
					a key encrypting key, a PIN, or a password in order to disguise the value of the underlying plaintext key.  </br>

					<br><a name="anchor14">
					14. <b>Encryption Algorithm</b>  - Set of mathematically expressed rules for rendering data
					unintelligible by executing a series of conversions controlled by a key.  </br>

					<br><a name="anchor15">
					15. <b>Entity</b>  - Either a subject (an active element that operates on information or the system state) or an object 
					(a passive element that contains or receives information).  </br>

					<br><a name="anchor16">
					16. <b>Firewall</b>   - A gateway that limits access between networks in accordance with local security policy. </br>

					<br><a name="anchor17">
					17. <b>Identifier</b>  - Unique data used to represent a person’s identity and associated
					attributes. A name or a card number are examples of identifiers. </br>

					<br><a name="anchor18">
					18. <b>Incident Response Plan</b>  - The documentation of a predetermined set of instructions or procedures to detect, 
					respond to, and limit consequences of a malicious cyber attacks against an organization’s information system(s). </br>

					<br><a name="anchor19">
					19. <b>Mobile Device</b>  - Portable cartridge/disk-based, removable storage media (e.g., floppy
					disks, compact disks, USB flash drives, external hard drives, and other flash memory cards/drives that contain nonvolatile memory).  </br>

					<br><a name="anchor20">
					20. <b>Multifactor Authentication</b>  - Authentication using two or more factors to achieve authentication. Factors include: 
					(i) something you know (e.g.，password/PIN); 
					(ii) something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); or 
					(iii) something you are (e.g., biometric).  </br>

					<br><a name="anchor21">
					21. <b>Password</b>   - A protected character string used to authenticate the identity of a computer system user or to authorize access to system resources.  </br>

					<br><a name="anchor22">
					22. <b>Privacy</b>   - Restricting access to subscriber or Relying Party information in accordance with federal law and agency policy.   </br>

					<br><a name="anchor23">
					23. <b>Protected Health Information (PHI)</b>   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule provides federal protections for personal health information 
					held by covered entities and gives patients an array of rights with respect to that information. At the same time, the Privacy 
					Rule is balanced so that it permits the disclosure of personal health information needed for patient care and other important 
					purposes.  </br>

					<br><a name="anchor24">
					24. <b>Remote Access</b>   - Access to an organizational information system by a user (or an information system acting on behalf of a user) communicating
					through an external network (e.g., the Internet).  </br>

					organizational assets, or individuals resulting from the operation of an information system given the potential impact 
					of a threat and the likelihood of that threat occurring.  </br>

					<br><a name="anchor26">
					26. <b>Security</b>   - A condition that results from the establishment and maintenance of protective measures that enable 
					an enterprise to perform its mission or critical functions despite risks posed by threats to its use of information systems. 
					Protective measures may involve a combination of deterrence, avoidance, prevention, detection, recovery, and correction 
					that should form part of the enterprise's risk management approach.   </br>

					<br><a name="anchor30">
					30. <b>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</b> - A virtual network, built on top of existing physical networks, that
					provides a secure communications tunnel for data and other information transmitted between networks.</br>

					<br><a name="anchor31">
					31. <b>Wi-Fi Protected Access-2 (WPA2)</b> - The approved Wi-Fi Alliance interoperable implementation of the
					IEEE 802.11i security standard. For federal government use, the implementation must use FIPS-approved encryption, such as AES.</br>

					<br><a name="anchor32">
					32. <b>Business Associate Agreement (BAA)</b> -   A "business associate" is a person or entity, other than a member of the workforce of a covered entity, who performs functions or activities on behalf of, or provides certain services to, a covered entity that involve access by the business associate to protected health information.  A "business associate" also is a subcontractor that creates, receives, maintains, or transmits protected health information on behalf of another business associate.  The HIPAA Rules generally require that covered entities and business associates enter into contracts with their business associates to ensure that the business associates will appropriately safeguard protected health information.</br>

					<br><a name="anchor33">
					33. <b>Cloud Computing</b> - A model for enabling on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable IT capabilities/ resources (e.g., networks, servers,
					storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider
					interaction. It allows users to access technology-based services from the network cloud without knowledge of, expertise with, or control
					over the technology infrastructure that supports them. This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics (on-demand selfservice,
					ubiquitous network access, location independent resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service); three service
					delivery models (Cloud Software as a Service [SaaS], Cloud Platform as a Service [PaaS], and Cloud Infrastructure as a Service [IaaS]);
					and four models for enterprise access (Private cloud, Community cloud, Public cloud, and Hybrid cloud). </br>
